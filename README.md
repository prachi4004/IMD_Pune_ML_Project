# IMD_Pune_ML_Project
Taking the rainfall data of two grid points of Goa station namely Panjim and Dabolim and we made a model that on receiving the data of the past three or seven days would give us the prediction of precipitation level for the next day in these cities. The rainfall data taken is the station data and the missing values in it is filled with gridded data from NetCDF files available on the official IMD Pune website.
